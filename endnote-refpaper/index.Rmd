# Introduction 
This book contains short notes on a selection of papers referred to in the end notes of *Statistical Rethinking* [@mcelreath2020statistical]. Some of these papers are very technically challenging statistically, and otherwise - and the notes represent my best attempts at trying to boil down the 'essence' of the papers. Of course, I'd be very happy to hear from any readers out there about potential additions, omission or errors.
